To do list
==========
This is more of a wishlist than a to do list.
It just list a number of improvements that could be made in the future.

*	Built-in detection and support for `<select>` inputs, including
	`<optgroup>`'s.
	Hide HTML and lazy-build.
*	Built-in detection and support for `<ul>`/`<ol>` HTML.
	Hide HTML and lazy-build (deep) tree.
*	Built-in detection and support for `<dl>` HTML.
	Use `<dt>` as value, `<dd>` as label.
	Hide HTML and lazy-build (deep) tree.
*	Include a Knockout.js binding.
	Figure out a way to specify traversion path.
*	Untangle the mess that is the `label`/`value`/`name` rendering.
